WELCOME TO MY PORTFOLIO
    - In the html you will find an index.html and that is where my website is. All ofther .html pages are links within the main page.

    -The whole website is fully functional and will work with both mobile and desktop. 

    - There are social media links that will actually take you to my social media, and the links at the bottom of the page will redirect you to the original tabs on the top of the website.

    - There are a total of 6 projects that lead you to nowhere because I have no projects yet! Hopefully in the coming months I'll be able to add a lot more to the website to fill up those empty project pages. 

    - You will also find tabs that say PROJECTS, ABOUT ME, and CONTACT. All pages have something written on them and the ABOUT ME page has a picture with a short description of myself for you all to read.
